# Malicious behaviour:

Network level: MU2 modifies and replayed malicious SV packets (10) to fake emergency situation on FDR (4 scenarios: (a)FDR1=22kV1=F_FDR1=2017; (b)FDR2=F_FDR2=2017; (c)FDR3=F_FDR3=2017; (d)FDR4=22kV3=F_FDR4=2017; interval = 1000 pkts).

Physical process level: Under normal operation, the fake emergency signals will deceive IEDs to trips CBs, and thus, disrupt power transmission.


**Attacks happen approximately at SmpCnt = 1000-1010, 2000-2010**
