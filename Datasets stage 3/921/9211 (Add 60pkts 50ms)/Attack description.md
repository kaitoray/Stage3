# Malicious behaviour:

Network level: MU1 replayed and injected malicious SV packets (60 pkts with 50ms HeartBeat) to fake emergency situation on 66kV (2 scenarios: 66kV1=F_66KV1=2017; 66kV3=F_66KV3=2017; interval = 2000 pkts).

Physical process level: Under normal operation, the fake emergency signals will deceive IEDs to trips CBs, and thus, disrupt power transmission.

**Attacks happen approximately at SmpCnt = 2000-2060, 4000-4060**
