# Malicious behaviour:

Network level: MU2 replayed and injected malicious SV packets (60 pkts with 50ms HB) to fake emergency situation on 22kV (2 scenarios: 22kV1=F_22kV1=2017; 22kV3=F_22kV3=2017; interval = 1000 pkts).

Physical process level: Under normal operation, the fake emergency signals will deceive IEDs to trips CBs, and thus, disrupt power transmission.

**Attacks happen approximately at SmpCnt = 1000-1060, 2000-2060**
