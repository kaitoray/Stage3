# Malicious behaviour:

Network level: Except the Benign publisher program, MU1 injects malicious SV messages mal_SV1_PUB (25ms) to fake normal situation only when a fault occurs (use the average values of the first 200 packets).

Physical process level: if a short circuit happens around transformers, Still tripped and protected.

**Emergency and attacks happen approximately at SmpCnt = 500-700, 2500-2700, 4500-4700, 6500-6700**
