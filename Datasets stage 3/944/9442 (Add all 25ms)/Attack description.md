Malicious behaviour:

Network level: Record a fault, then after 2000 packets, MU2 replayed and injected malicious SV packets (all 25ms HB) to fake emergency situation on FDR (4 scenarios) following the KCL/KVL laws.

Physical process level: Under normal operation, the fake emergency signals will deceive IEDs to trips CBs, and thus, disrupt power transmission.

**Emergency happens approximately at SmpCnt = 500-700, 3500-3700, 6500-6700, 9500-9700**
**Attacks happen approximately at SmpCnt = 2500-2700, 5500-5700, 8500-8700, 11500-11700**
