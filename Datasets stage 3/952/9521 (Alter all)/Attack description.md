# Malicious behaviour:

Network level: Record a fault, then after 2000 packets, MU1 modifies and replayed malicious SV packets (all) to fake emergency situation on TRSF (2 scenarios) following the KCL/KVL laws.

Physical process level: Under normal operation, the fake emergency signals will deceive IEDs to trips CBs, and thus, disrupt power transmission.

**Emergency happens approximately at SmpCnt = 500-700, 4500-4700**
**Attacks happen approximately at SmpCnt = 2500-2700, 6500-6700**
