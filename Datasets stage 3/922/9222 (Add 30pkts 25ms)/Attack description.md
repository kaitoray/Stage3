# Malicious behaviour:

Network level: MU1 replayed and injected malicious SV packets (30 pkts with 25ms HB) to fake emergency situation on TRSF (2 scenarios: 66kV1=TRSF1W1=TRSF1W2=TRSF1_CB=F_TRSF1=2017; 66kV3=TRSF2W1=TRSF2W2=TRSF2_CB=F_TRSF2=2017).

Physical process level: Under normal operation, the fake emergency signals will deceive IEDs to trips CBs, and thus, disrupt power transmission.

**Attacks happen approximately at SmpCnt = 2000-2030, 4000-4030**
