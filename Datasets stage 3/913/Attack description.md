# Malicious behaviour:

Network level: MU1 alters messages to fake normal situation even when a fault occurs (use the average values of the first 200 packets).

Physical process level: if a short circuit happens around transformers, SV messages still indicate everything is under normal operation, thus protection mechanism will fail.

**Emergency and attacks happen approximately at SmpCnt = 500-800, 1500-2000, 2500-2900, 3500-3900**
