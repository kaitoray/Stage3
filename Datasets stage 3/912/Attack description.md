# Malicious behaviour:

Network level: Except the Benign publisher program, MU2 injects malicious SV messages mal_SV2_PUB (25ms) to fake normal situation only when a fault occurs (use the average values of the first 200 packets).

Physical process level: if a short circuit happens around transformers, Still tripped and protected.

**Emergency and attacks happen approximately at SmpCnt = 500-700, 1500-1700, 2500-2700, 3500-3700, 4500-4700, 5500-5700**
