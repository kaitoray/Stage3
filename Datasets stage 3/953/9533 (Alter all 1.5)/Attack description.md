# Malicious behaviour:

Network level: Record a fault, then after 2000 packets, MU2 modifies and replayed malicious SV packets (all with values*1.5) to fake emergency situation on 22kV (2 scenarios) following the KCL/KVL laws.

Physical process level: Under normal operation, the fake emergency signals will deceive IEDs to trips CBs, and thus, disrupt power transmission.

**Emergency happens approximately at SmpCnt = 500-700, 3500-3700**
**Attacks happen approximately at SmpCnt = 2500-2700, 5500-5700**
